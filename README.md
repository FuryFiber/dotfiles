Configuration for my pop-os laptop and desktop.
These are just the config files I could find. There is a lot missing but idk how to add those.
things that are missing:
  - gnome shell extensions (added but not shure if they work)
  - jetbrains ide settings
  - fonts
  - firefox setup: https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade with https://furyfiber.github.io/startpage/ as startpage using https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage.
    - also a lot of firefox extensions  

  - probably a lot more but i cant think of them right now
